                          by your keyboard will have effect.
     <brightness>         Set brightness by passing a value between 0 and 255.
```

### Custom Colors

As of 0.5 you can add your own custom colors, by creating a `colors.conf` file in a directory `/etc/tuxedo-backlight-control`. The file should have a format like:

```python
my_color1=123456
my_color2=654321
```

The colors added here will be usable both in the CLI, and appear in the color dropdown in the UI.
The values should be valid HEX colors, the keys can only contain alphanumeric characters. 

Development of this software is done on Clevo N150-ZU / N151-ZU. Only single color mode is known to work for these the models.
